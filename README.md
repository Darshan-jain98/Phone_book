# Phone_book

Phonebook Management System C++ Project.\
# Introduction:

The phonebook is a very simple C++ (oop) mini-project that can help you understand the basic concepts of functions, file handling, and data structure. This program will teach you how to add, list, change or edit, search and remove data from/to a file. Adding new records, listing them, editing and updating them, looking for saved contacts, and removing phonebook records are simple Functions that make up the main menu of this Phonebook program.

Personal information, such as name, gender, phone number, e-mail, and address, is requested when you add a record to your phonebook. These records can then be updated, entered, searched, and deleted. I’ve used a lot of functions in this mini-project. These functions are easy to understand since their name means just their respective operations.
